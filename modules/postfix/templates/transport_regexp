# temporary work around for bugzilla being unable to send mail to webteam
#
# the current setup ( 13/02/2011 ) is that most active mls are on zarb.org,
# using @mageia domain. But we want to start hosting aliases on the current
# ml server ( and main smtp, ie alamut ). So we need to dispatch old mls
# to zarb, and the rest on alamut. Old mls are all prefixed by mageia-*@mageia
# this hack should be removed once all mls are migrated from zarb.org
